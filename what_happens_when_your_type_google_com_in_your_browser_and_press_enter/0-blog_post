# What Happens When You Type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) and Press Enter?

Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you type `https://www.google.com` into your web browser and hit Enter? That seemingly simple action initiates a complex sequence of steps involving multiple systems and protocols. This process is foundational to understanding how the modern web works.

In this article, we'll explore the end-to-end journey of your request, covering the following key components:

* DNS Request
* TCP/IP
* Firewall
* HTTPS/SSL
* Load Balancer
* Web Server
* Application Server
* Database

## 1. DNS Request: Finding the Server

The journey begins with resolving the human-readable domain name `www.google.com` into an IP address that machines understand.

### How it works:

* The browser first checks its DNS cache.
* If not found, the request is sent to your operating system, which may consult the router or ISP‚Äôs DNS resolver.
* If needed, the DNS resolver contacts root name servers, TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, and finally Google's authoritative name server.
* The result is an IP address, such as `142.250.190.68`, which is returned to the browser.

This step is crucial because all subsequent communication depends on knowing the correct IP address of the server.

## 2. TCP/IP: Establishing a Connection

With the IP address known, the browser uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to establish a connection.

### Process:

* **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) initiates a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to ensure a reliable connection.
* **IP** (Internet Protocol) routes packets between your device and Google‚Äôs server.

TCP/IP ensures that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct order across the network.

## 3. Firewall: Protecting the Network

Before your request leaves your machine and after it arrives at Google‚Äôs data center, it must pass through firewalls.

### Functions:

* On your end, a local or router-based firewall checks outgoing traffic.
* At Google‚Äôs end, firewalls filter incoming requests to protect against malicious activity.

Firewalls act as gatekeepers, enforcing security policies by allowing or blocking traffic based on IP address, port, or protocol.

---

## 4. HTTPS/SSL: Securing the Communication

Since the URL starts with `https://`, your browser initiates an encrypted connection using SSL/TLS protocols.

### What happens:

* The browser and server perform an SSL handshake.
* The server presents its digital certificate, which the browser verifies.
* A session key is negotiated and used to encrypt subsequent communication.

This ensures data privacy, integrity, and authentication between your device and Google.

---

## 5. Load Balancer: Distributing the Load

Once inside Google‚Äôs infrastructure, your request first hits a **load balancer**.

### Responsibilities:

* Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers.
* Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
* Routes traffic based on location, server health, and current load.

Google‚Äôs global load balancers ensure that your request is handled quickly and efficiently, often by a nearby server.

---

## 6. Web Server: Handling the HTTP Request

Next, your request is forwarded to a **web server**, such as Google‚Äôs custom infrastructure or an Nginx/Apache server.

### Tasks:

* Parses the incoming HTTP request.
* Serves static content directly (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS).
* For dynamic content, it delegates the request to an application server.

---

## 7. Application Server: Executing Logic

The web server hands off dynamic requests to an **application server**, which runs the backend logic.

### Actions:

* Processes input (e.g., search query).
* Handles sessions and cookies.
* Interacts with one or more databases.
* Generates an appropriate response (usually in HTML or JSON).

---

## 8. Database: Accessing Data

The application server may query a **database** to fetch or update data.

### Google‚Äôs databases:

* Likely a mix of highly-optimized, distributed databases.
* Store search indexes, user preferences, and session data.
* Return results that are used to craft the final web page.

---

## The Response

Finally, the generated response travels back:

1. From the application server to the web server.
2. Through the load balancer.
3. Over the encrypted HTTPS connection.
4. Into your browser, where the HTML is parsed and rendered.

All of this happens in fractions of a second.

## Conclusion

Typing `https://www.google.com` and pressing Enter triggers a rich and intricate series of steps:

* üß≠ **DNS** resolves the domain.
* üåê **TCP/IP** establishes the connection.
* üî• **Firewalls** secure traffic.
* üîí **HTTPS/SSL** encrypts data.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Load balancers** optimize resource use.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Web servers** process requests.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Application servers** execute business logic.
* üóÑÔ∏è **Databases** supply the data.

Understanding this flow is fundamental for any software engineer‚Äîit bridges front-end, back-end, and infrastructure knowledge into one cohesive system.
